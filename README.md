# dialogue-system-language-game

This repository contains all of the fun projects that I made using conversational AI during my Dialogue System course at the University of Gothenburg.

To test my most recent project, simply go here: https://celinenausicaa.github.io/dialogue-systems-1-2023/

Note that you might need to clear the cache to see the images clearly. 

You will also need to know basic Swedish, as this is a game designed to help L2 learners acquire vocabulary in Swedish!
